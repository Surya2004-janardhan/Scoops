# Scoops

*where backend concepts get scooped up and devoured*

---

## wait what is this?

hey there! this is my little playground where I break things, fix them, and occasionally learn something. it's a study repo - meaning everything here exists because I was curious and wanted to understand how stuff actually works.

**fair warning:** the code might be messy, the comments might be weird, and some things might not even work. that's the point. we're learning here.

## what's inside?

| folder | what's cooking |
|--------|----------------|
| `Backend/` | express + mongodb doing their thing |
| `rabbitmq/` | bunnies delivering messages (queue stuff) |
| `Redis/` | fast boi caching & rate limiting |
| `Docker/` | putting things in boxes |
| `mongoDB/` | notes & wisdom about the document life |

---

## how to run stuff?

each folder has its own README with commands. go explore.

you'll need:
- node.js (obviously)
- mongodb running somewhere
- redis if you're feeling spicy
- rabbitmq for the message queue goodness

## why "scoops"?

because we're scooping up knowledge, one confusing concept at a time.

also ice cream is nice.

*happy learning!*
