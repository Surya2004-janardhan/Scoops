horizontal scaling vs vertical scaling

horizontal scaling - it scales by adding more machines to the pool of resources, 
allowing for increased capacity and performance. It is often used in distributed systems 
and cloud environments.

DAIGRAM  for horizontal scaling:
[Client] --> [Load Balancer] --> [Server 1]
                          --> [Server 2]
                          --> [Server 3]

vertical scaling - it scales by adding more resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to a single machine,
allowing for increased capacity and performance. It is often used in traditional on-premises
environments.

DAIGRAM for vertical scaling:
[Client] --> [Server with increased resources (CPU, RAM, storage)]
