MONGODB 
only writing short points max word count per line is 10 words

- NoSQL database, document-oriented
- Uses BSON format for data storage

{ 

    name : 
    age : 
    address :
}
- Schema-less, flexible data model
- High scalability and performance


similarities to sql 
- Both are databases for storing and managing data
- Support CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Use query languages for data manipulation
- Can be used for various applications and industries

disimilarities to sql
- MongoDB is NoSQL, SQL databases are relational
- MongoDB uses BSON, SQL databases use tables and rows
- MongoDB is schema-less, SQL databases require a defined schema
- MongoDB is designed for horizontal scaling, SQL databases often scale vertically

applications of mongodb
- Web applications
- Mobile applications
- Real-time analytics
- Content management systems

specific use cases by taking real time applications social media platforms

- User profiles and posts storage coz of flexible schema
- Real-time analytics for user engagement and trends
- Content management for multimedia and user-generated content
- High scalability to handle large user base and traffic

why cant we use sql for social media platforms
- SQL databases may struggle with the high volume of unstructured data
- Scaling SQL databases can be more complex and costly
- SQL databases may not provide the same level of performance for real-time analytics

example data for real time analysis nd how mongo stores those data
- User interactions (likes, comments, shares) stored as documents
- Each document can contain nested data for user details and post information
{
    userId: "12345",
    postId: "67890",
    interactions: {
        likes: 100,
        comments: 50,
        shares: 20
    },
    archieve : true,
    visible : false,
    timestamp: ISODate("2024-06-01T12:00:00Z")
}
- MongoDB allows for easy querying and aggregation of this data for real-time insights



other industry aspects of mongodb
- E-commerce: product catalogs, customer data, order management
- Healthcare: patient records, medical research data
- IoT: sensor data, device management
- Gaming: player profiles, game state management
